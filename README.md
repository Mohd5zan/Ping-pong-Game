# Ping-pong-Game
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Pong game, built using the raylib library for graphical output and input handling in C++.

Features
Two players: One controlled by the user and the other controlled by the CPU.
Score tracking: Player and CPU scores are displayed on the screen, and the game resets the ball position after a player scores.
Realistic ball movement: The ball bounces off the top and bottom edges of the screen and reverses direction when it collides with either paddle.
Smooth paddle control: The player can control their paddle using the arrow keys (Up and Down), while the CPU paddle moves automatically in response to the ball's position.
Simple and clean design: The game features colored backgrounds, a centerline, and a circle in the middle of the screen for a minimalistic yet appealing design.

Controls
Up Arrow: Move the player's paddle up.
Down Arrow: Move the player's paddle down.

Dependencies
The project uses the raylib library for graphics and input.
