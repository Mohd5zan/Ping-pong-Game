# Ping-pong-Game
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Pong game, built using the raylib library for graphical output and input handling in C++.<br>

Features<br>
Two players: One controlled by the user and the other controlled by the CPU.<br>
Score tracking: Player and CPU scores are displayed on the screen, and the game resets the ball position after a player scores.<br>
Realistic ball movement: The ball bounces off the top and bottom edges of the screen and reverses direction when it collides with either paddle.<br>
Smooth paddle control: The player can control their paddle using the arrow keys (Up and Down), while the CPU paddle moves automatically in response to the ball's position.<br>
Simple and clean design: The game features colored backgrounds, a centerline, and a circle in the middle of the screen for a minimalistic yet appealing design.<br>

Controls<br>
Up Arrow: Move the player's paddle up.<br>
Down Arrow: Move the player's paddle down.<br>

Dependencies<br>
The project uses the raylib library for graphics and input.
